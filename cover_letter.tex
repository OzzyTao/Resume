%------------------------------------------------


I'm a PhD Candidate from RMIT University, expecting to submit my thesis in three months. My research interest falls in the field of Geospatial Science. Specifically, my PhD topic is about modeling and analyzing a particular type of movement data -- checkpoint movement data. 
As appose to GPS trajectory of a moving object, which is recorded in fixed temporal frequency, checkpoint movement data is the type of movement observations collected at fixed locations in space. Movement data collected with sensor network, cellular network and transport smart card system are all examples of checkpoint data.
My research involves various work including conceptual model design for spatio-temporal data, data analytics design, software implementation and so on. 
During my research, I developed enormous interest for data science and skills for using data science for solving piratical problems.

With a background in Computer Science and IT, I have extensive experience in software development and coding.  
Specifically, I have been using python heavily for database programming and spatial algorithm development.
I also have in-depth knowledge of different GIS platforms including but not limited to ArcGIS, QGIS, CartoDB and PostGIS. I've worked on several spatial projects using various GIS systems, operating them with both graphical interface and automated scripts. For my research work, I used PostGIS heavily to manipulate spatial objects in a large volume.
In addition, I have experience developing Web Mapping Application to share spatial information with large audience. I developed a Flood Risk Web Application during my internship in ThinkSpatial. With the tool a user can well understand how risky his/her house is exposing to flood of different severity.
In addition, I'm familiar with various Python Statistics packages and Machine learning packages which have saved me quite a lot of time for my data analytics tasks.

Having working on a PhD project for 3 years in the field, I'm quite familiar with spatial industry and prepared to explore further in the field as a data scientist.

For those reasons above, I believe I'm going to fit this position quite well. 
I look forward to meeting you soon.
